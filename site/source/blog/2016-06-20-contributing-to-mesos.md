The Mesos project has a large community of users and contributors, and is
growing rapidly. The growth, while being very beneficial for the project, brings
some challenges.

In particular, the community has to make sure that everyone’s interests are
being met. This isn’t always easy due to occasional conflicts of interest. For
example, developers are eager to see their patches vetted and committed to the
codebase as rapidly as possible, whereas production users of Mesos want to make
sure that the stability of the software is never compromised for the sake
rolling out new features. Both are essential components of a healthy open source
infrastructure project, and we want to strike a harmonizing balance.

Transparency is the key for being able to grow the community while also making
sure that participants understand and agree with the development direction. In
this post - much of which derives from my recent [MesosCon 2016 presentation] -
we are going to present some statistics that reflect the current state of the
community participation. The timeframe for the following statistics ranges from
the 0.24 release until June 1, 2016.

// Community Growing
<div id="number_of_contributors_and_committers_per_release"></div>

The number of unique contributors has been increasing steadily over time. The
most recent number of unique contributors is 76. This is an improvement from
the 0.24 release for which there were 47 unique contributors!

// Contributor Diversity

We also compared the unique number of contributors by organization. While
Mesosphere (blue line) has had a dominating number of contributors for some
time, today there are more independent contributors than contributors at any
individual organization.

This is a great milestone for the all of our individual contributors out there,
and we certainly appreciate your contribution to the project.

// Commit Diversity
<div id="commit_breakdown_by_organizations_and_releases"></div>
<div id="commit_breakdown_by_organizations_and_months"></div>
<div id="commit_breakdown_by_contributors_and_committers"></div>

While the number of contributors has been balancing out, the number of commits
are not quite as diverse. Mesosphere contributes 62.8% of the commits as of
today, and it would be great to see more contributions from other organizations
and individuals being accepted into the project.

There are proposals being drafted to help improve the contribution experience on
the Mesos project. Some of the ideas include improving the developer tools,
collecting and analyzing metrics around reviews, and ways to incentivize
shepherds and reviewers.

Stay tuned for more news on the dev list!
